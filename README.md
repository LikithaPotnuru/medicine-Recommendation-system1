# Medicine Recommendation System

## üéØ Objective

The aim of this project is to build a **Medicine Recommendation System** that suggests suitable medicines to users based on their symptoms. The system not only recommends medicines but also provides precautions and takes into account the user‚Äôs medical history if available.

## ‚úÖ What We Have Done (Features / Work Done)

* Preprocessed and cleaned the medicine dataset (`cleaned_medicine_data.csv`).
* Implemented a recommendation logic to map symptoms to medicines.
* Built scripts for inserting medicine data into the database (`insert_medicines.py`).
* Developed an **API layer** (`api.py`) to serve medicine recommendations programmatically.
* Created an **application interface** (`app.py`) for user interaction.
* Documented and explored the logic in `Medicine_project.ipynb`.
